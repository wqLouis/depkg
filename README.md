# Wallpaper Engine Pkg Parser

A high-performance Rust library and command-line tool designed for parsing Wallpaper Engine `.pkg` archives and `.tex` texture files.

## ✨ Features

*    **Robust Extraction**: Seamlessly extracts files from `.pkg` archives while perfectly preserving the original directory structure.
